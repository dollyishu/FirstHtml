                HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
                HTML describes the structure of a Web page
                HTML consists of a series of elements
                HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
                HTML elements are represented by tags
                HTML tags label pieces of content such as "heading", "paragraph", "table", and so on
                Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to render the content of the page

                Corgis were herding sheep, geese, ducks, horses, and cattle and
                are one of the oldest herding breed of dogs. Pembroke Welsh Corgis
                are closely related to Schipperkes, Keeshonds, Pomeranians, Samoyeds,
                Chow Chows, Norwegian Elkhounds, and Finnish Spitz. Corgis are the cutest dogs.

                CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
                CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
                CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
                External stylesheets are stored in CSS files
                Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation 
                of a document written in a markup language like HTML.
                CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
